            li Many of the new features in Office 2013 are geared towards saving and sharing files online. 
            li To use these features, you'll need to get a free Microsoft account (previously called a Windows Live ID) if you don't already have one. 
            li You can then log in to your Microsoft account to access your OneDrive which is an online storage space for your documents and other files.

        ul
            li Access your files anywhere: You can save files to your OneDrive, so you'll be able to access them from any computer that has an internet connection. This also helps to keep your files safe if anything happens to your computer.
            li Edit documents in your web browser: If you're using a computer that doesn't have Microsoft Office, you can use Office Online (previously known as Office Web Apps) to edit documents in your browser for free. Office Online includes simplified versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote.
            li Share files: It's easy to share your OneDrive files with friends or coworkers. You can choose whether they can edit or just read the files. This option is great for collaboration because multiple people can edit a document at the same time (also known as co-authoring).

        p PowerPoint 2013 is similar to PowerPoint 2010. If you've previously used PowerPoint 2010, PowerPoint 2013 should feel familiar. But if you are new to PowerPoint or have more experience with older versions, you should first take some time to become familiar with the PowerPoint 2013 interface

          h2 To replace text:
          li At times, you may discover that you've repeatedly made a mistake throughout your presentation (such as misspelling someone's name), or that you need to exchange a particular word or phrase for another. You can use the Replace feature to make quick revisions. In our example, we'll replace with word "pounds" with the abbreviation "lbs."

      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
          li From the Home tab, click the Replace command.

      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
          li If the text is found, it will be selected. Review the text to make sure you want to replace it.
          li If you wish to replace it, select one of the replace options. Replace will replace individual instances, and Replace All will replace every instance. In our example, we'll use the Replace option.

      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
          img(src="images/text/find7.png")

      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')

          img(src="images/text/find8.png")

      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
          li You'll need to be careful when using the Replace All option. In the example below, changing the word "Pounds" to "lbs." would have been incorrect in this context. You can click Find Next to skip to the next instance without replacing the text.
      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
       
          li If you're using a theme, you'll probably find that your presentation looks pretty good. All of the colors will work well together, which means you won't have to spend as much time formatting your presentation. But there's another great reason to use theme elements: When you switch to a different theme, all of those elements will update to reflect the new theme. You can drastically change the look of your presentation in a few clicks.

      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
          h2. Theme elements
          p Every PowerPoint theme, including the default Office theme, has its own theme elements. Those elements are: 
          li Theme Colors: There are 10 theme colors, along with darker and lighter variations, available from every Color menu.
          img(src="images/applytheme/theme_understand_color.png")
      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
          li Theme Fonts: There are two theme fonts available at the top of the Font menu under Theme Fonts.
          img(src="images/applytheme/theme_understand_font.png")
      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
          li Theme Effects: These affect the preset shape styles. You can find shape styles on the Format tab whenever you select a shape or SmartArt graphic.
          img(src="images/applytheme/theme_element_effect.png")

      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')

         li In our examples above, you can see the effect of applying different themes to the same slide—each theme uses its own fonts and colors. But you may have also noticed that the font and colors of the logo in the bottom-right remained unchanged: This is because they're Standard Colors and Fonts rather than theme elements. Colors and fonts will only update if you're using Theme Fonts or Theme Colors.
      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         li As you can see from the two different Title Slides above, themes can also change various slide layouts. Some themes, like the Wisp theme in the example below, even include additional layouts.

     section
         h2 About transitions
         br
         p There are three categories of unique transitions to choose from, all of which can be found on the Transitions tab:
           li Subtle: These are the most basic types of transitions. They use simple animations to move between slides.
    
     section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         img(src="images/trans/tran1.png")
     section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         p Exciting: These use more complex animations to transition between slides. While they're more visually interesting than Subtle transitions, adding too many can make your presentation look less professional. However, when used in moderation they can add an nice touch between important slides.

         img(src="images/trans/tran2.png")

     section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         p Dynamic Content: If you're transitioning between two slides that use similar slide layouts, dynamic transitions will move only the placeholders, not the slides themselves. When used correctly, dynamic transitions can help to unify your slides and add a further level of polish to your presentation.

        h2 Print Layouts
        p  PowerPoint includes several different layouts when printing a presentation. The layout you choose will mostly depend on why you're printing the slide show. There are four different print layouts:
    
      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
        li Full-page slides: This prints a full page for each slide in your presentation. This layout would be most useful if you needed to review or edit a printed copy of your presentation.

        li Indenting will give different results, depending upon whether you are working with a list or a paragraph:

      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
        li List: Indenting a line of a list creates a multilevel list. This means the indented line is a subtopic of the line above it. Multilevel lists are useful if you want to create an outline or hierarchy.
        img(src="images/indent/indent3.png")

      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')

You can reduce the line spacing to fit more lines on a slide, or you can increase it to improve readability. In some instances, PowerPoint may automatically change the font size when you adjust the line spacing, so increasing the line spacing too much may cause the text to be too small.
