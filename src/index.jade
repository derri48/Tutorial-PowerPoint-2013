            li Many of the new features in Office 2013 are geared towards saving and sharing files online. 
            li To use these features, you'll need to get a free Microsoft account (previously called a Windows Live ID) if you don't already have one. 
            li You can then log in to your Microsoft account to access your OneDrive which is an online storage space for your documents and other files.

        ul
            li Access your files anywhere: You can save files to your OneDrive, so you'll be able to access them from any computer that has an internet connection. This also helps to keep your files safe if anything happens to your computer.
            li Edit documents in your web browser: If you're using a computer that doesn't have Microsoft Office, you can use Office Online (previously known as Office Web Apps) to edit documents in your browser for free. Office Online includes simplified versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote.
            li Share files: It's easy to share your OneDrive files with friends or coworkers. You can choose whether they can edit or just read the files. This option is great for collaboration because multiple people can edit a document at the same time (also known as co-authoring).

        p PowerPoint 2013 is similar to PowerPoint 2010. If you've previously used PowerPoint 2010, PowerPoint 2013 should feel familiar. But if you are new to PowerPoint or have more experience with older versions, you should first take some time to become familiar with the PowerPoint 2013 interface

          h2 To replace text:
          li At times, you may discover that you've repeatedly made a mistake throughout your presentation (such as misspelling someone's name), or that you need to exchange a particular word or phrase for another. You can use the Replace feature to make quick revisions. In our example, we'll replace with word "pounds" with the abbreviation "lbs."

      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
          li From the Home tab, click the Replace command.

      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
          li If the text is found, it will be selected. Review the text to make sure you want to replace it.
          li If you wish to replace it, select one of the replace options. Replace will replace individual instances, and Replace All will replace every instance. In our example, we'll use the Replace option.

      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
          img(src="images/text/find7.png")

      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')

          img(src="images/text/find8.png")

      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
          li You'll need to be careful when using the Replace All option. In the example below, changing the word "Pounds" to "lbs." would have been incorrect in this context. You can click Find Next to skip to the next instance without replacing the text.
      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
       
          li If you're using a theme, you'll probably find that your presentation looks pretty good. All of the colors will work well together, which means you won't have to spend as much time formatting your presentation. But there's another great reason to use theme elements: When you switch to a different theme, all of those elements will update to reflect the new theme. You can drastically change the look of your presentation in a few clicks.

      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
          h2. Theme elements
          p Every PowerPoint theme, including the default Office theme, has its own theme elements. Those elements are: 
          li Theme Colors: There are 10 theme colors, along with darker and lighter variations, available from every Color menu.
          img(src="images/applytheme/theme_understand_color.png")
      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
          li Theme Fonts: There are two theme fonts available at the top of the Font menu under Theme Fonts.
          img(src="images/applytheme/theme_understand_font.png")
      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
          li Theme Effects: These affect the preset shape styles. You can find shape styles on the Format tab whenever you select a shape or SmartArt graphic.
          img(src="images/applytheme/theme_element_effect.png")

      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')

         li In our examples above, you can see the effect of applying different themes to the same slide—each theme uses its own fonts and colors. But you may have also noticed that the font and colors of the logo in the bottom-right remained unchanged: This is because they're Standard Colors and Fonts rather than theme elements. Colors and fonts will only update if you're using Theme Fonts or Theme Colors.
      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         li As you can see from the two different Title Slides above, themes can also change various slide layouts. Some themes, like the Wisp theme in the example below, even include additional layouts.

     section
         h2 About transitions
         br
         p There are three categories of unique transitions to choose from, all of which can be found on the Transitions tab:
           li Subtle: These are the most basic types of transitions. They use simple animations to move between slides.
    
     section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         img(src="images/trans/tran1.png")
     section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         p Exciting: These use more complex animations to transition between slides. While they're more visually interesting than Subtle transitions, adding too many can make your presentation look less professional. However, when used in moderation they can add an nice touch between important slides.

         img(src="images/trans/tran2.png")

     section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         p Dynamic Content: If you're transitioning between two slides that use similar slide layouts, dynamic transitions will move only the placeholders, not the slides themselves. When used correctly, dynamic transitions can help to unify your slides and add a further level of polish to your presentation.

        h2 Print Layouts
        p  PowerPoint includes several different layouts when printing a presentation. The layout you choose will mostly depend on why you're printing the slide show. There are four different print layouts:
    
      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
        li Full-page slides: This prints a full page for each slide in your presentation. This layout would be most useful if you needed to review or edit a printed copy of your presentation.

        li Indenting will give different results, depending upon whether you are working with a list or a paragraph:

      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
        li List: Indenting a line of a list creates a multilevel list. This means the indented line is a subtopic of the line above it. Multilevel lists are useful if you want to create an outline or hierarchy.
        img(src="images/indent/indent3.png")

      section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')

You can reduce the line spacing to fit more lines on a slide, or you can increase it to improve readability. In some instances, PowerPoint may automatically change the font size when you adjust the line spacing, so increasing the line spacing too much may cause the text to be too small.

Additionally, cropped areas of pictures are saved with the presentation by default, which can add to the file size. PowerPoint can reduce the file size by compressing pictures, lowering their resolution, and deleting cropped areas.

            p Pictures, shapes, clip art, and text boxes can all be grouped together; however, placeholders cannot be grouped. If you will be grouping pictures, use one of the commands in the Images group on the Insert tab to insert pictures instead of the picture icon inside the placeholder.

            h2 Animating Text and Objects
            p In PowerPoint, you can animate text and objects such as clip art, shapes, and pictures. Animation—or movement—on the slide can be used to draw the audience's attention to specific content or to make the slide easier to read.

         section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
            h3 The four types of animations :
            li Entrance: These control how the object enters the slide. For example, with the Bounce animation the object will "fall" onto the slide and then bounce several times.
            img(src="images/animation/effect2.jpeg")

         section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
            li Emphasis: These animations occur while the object is on the slide, often triggered by a mouse click. For example, you can set an object to Spin when you click the mouse.
            img(src="images/animation/effect1.jpeg")

         section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
            li Exit: These control how the object exits the slide. For example, with the Fade animation the object will simply fade away.

         section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')

           h3 To change the chart type:

           p Sometimes you may want to change the way charts group your data. For example, in the chart below the book sales data is grouped by genre, with columns for each year. However, we could switch the rows and columns so the chart will group the data by year, with columns for each genre. In both cases, the chart contains the same data—it's just organized differently.

If PowerPoint says something is an error, you can choose not to change it using one of three options:

         section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
           li Ignore: This will skip the word without changing it.
           li Ignore All: This will skip the word without changing it, and it will also skip all other instances of the word in your presentation.

         h2 Reviewing Presentations
         p Before presenting your PowerPoint presentation, you might decide to ask someone else to look over it. The two of you might even collaborate on a presentation. If you were revising a hard copy of a report, you might add comments in the margins or compare your rough and final drafts side by side. You can also do these things in PowerPoint using the Comments and Compare features.

          h2 Commenting on presentations
          p When you are revising or collaborating on a presentation, you might want to make notes or suggestions without actually changing anything on the slide. Using comments allows you to take note of anything on a slide without altering the slide itself. Comments can be added and read by the original author or any other reviewers.

          h2 Slide Master View
          h3 What is Slide Master view?

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         p Slide Master view is a special feature in PowerPoint that allows you to quickly modify the slides and slide layouts in your presentation. From there, you can edit the slide master, which will affect every slide in the presentation. You can also modify individual slide layouts, which will change any slides using those layouts.

         p For example, let's say you find a theme you like but you don't like the slide layouts. You could use Slide Master view to customize the layouts exactly the way you want them to look.

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         h3 Using Slide Master view
         p Whether you're making significant changes to your slides or just a few small tweaks, Slide Master view can help you create a consistent, professional presentation without a lot of effort. You could use Slide Master view to change just about anything in your presentation, but here are some of its most common uses:

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         li Modify backgrounds: Slide Master view makes it easy to customize the background for all of your slides at the same time. For example, you could add a watermark or logo to each slide in your presentation, or you could modify the background graphics of an existing PowerPoint theme.

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         li Rearrange placeholders: If you find that you often rearrange the placeholders on each slide, you can save time by rearranging them in Slide Master view instead. When you adjust one of the layouts in Slide Master view, all of the slides with that layout will change.

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         li Customize text formatting: Rather than changing the text color on each slide individually, you could use the Slide Master to change the text color on all slides at once.

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         li Create unique slide layouts: If you want to create a presentation that looks distinct from regular PowerPoint themes, you could use Slide Master view to create your own layouts. Custom layouts can include your own background graphics, and placeholders.

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         h3 To make changes to all slides:
         p If you want to change something on all slides of your presentation, you can edit the Slide Master. In our example, we'll add a logo to every slide.

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         li Select the View tab, then click the Slide Master command. 
         img(src="images/slidemaster/master_all_command.png")

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         li The presentation will switch to Slide Master view, and the Slide Master tab will be selected on the Ribbon.

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         li In the left navigation pane, scroll up and select the first slide. This is the slide master.

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         img(src="images/slidemaster/master_all_select.png")

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         li Use the desired tabs on the Ribbon to make changes to the Slide Master. In our example, we’ll insert a picture in the upper-left corner of the slide.

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         img(src="images/slidemaster/master_all_insert_picture.png")

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         li Move, resize, or delete other slide objects as needed. In our example, we'll resize the background graphic to fit below our newly inserted logo.

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         img(src="images/slidemaster/master_all_resize.png")

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         li When you’re finished, click the Close Master View command on the Slide Master tab.
         img(src="images/slidemaster/master_all_close.png")

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         li The change will appear on all slides of the presentation.

          img(src="images/slidemaster/master_all_done.jpeg")

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         p When you make a change to the Slide Master, it's a good idea to review your presentation to see how it affects each slide. You may find that some of your slides don't look exactly right. On the next page, we'll show you how to fix this by customizing individual slide layouts.

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         h2 Customizing slide layouts

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         p You can use Slide Master view to modify any slide layout in your presentation. It's easy to make small tweaks like adjusting background graphics and more significant changes like rearranging or deleting placeholders. Unlike the Slide Master, changes to a slide layout will only be applied to slides using that layout in your presentation.

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         h3 To customize an existing slide layout:
         p In our example, our newly added logo overlaps a background graphic in the Content with Caption Layout. We'll customize this layout to make room for the logo.

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         li Navigate to Slide Master view.
         li Locate and select the desired layout in the left navigation pane. You can hover the mouse over each layout to see which slides are currently using that layout in the presentation.

         img(src="images/slidemaster/master_layout_hide.png")

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         li Add, move, or delete any objects as desired. In our example, we'll move the red arrow to better show our new logo.

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         img(src="images/slidemaster/master_move_arrow.png")

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         li If you want to change the arrangement of the placeholders, you can move, resize, or delete any of them. In our example, we'll move our placeholders down to align with the red arrow.

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         img(src="images/slidemaster/master_move_placeholder.png")

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         h3 Customizing text formatting
         p You can also customize the text formatting from Slide Master view, including the font, text size, color, and alignment. For example, if you wanted to change the font for every title placeholder in your presentation, you could modify the master title style on the Slide Master.

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         img(src="images/slidemaster/master_font_change.png")

       section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
         p Each title placeholder is connected to the master title style on the Slide Master. As you can see in the example below, modifying the font on the Slide Master changed the title font on each slide.

         p One of the most powerful features of Slide Master view is the option to create new slide layouts. This is an easy way to add interesting and unique slide layouts to an existing theme. You could even use this feature to design an entirely new theme, as in the example below.

            p In PowerPoint, you can use hyperlinks to link to resources that are not online. To create a quick way to refer to another slide in your presentation, you can create a hyperlink to that slide. If you need to access a file stored on your computer, you can create a hyperlink to it. Additionally, PowerPoint allows you to format pictures and shapes as hyperlinks.

            h3 Using shapes and pictures as hyperlinks
            p Sometimes you might want to to format objects—including shapes, text boxes, and pictures—as hyperlinks. This is especially helpful if you want the object to act like a button. To do this, simply right-click the desired object and select Hyperlink from the menu that appears. Click the object during the presentation to open the hyperlink.

         section.emphatic-text(data-bespoke-backdrop='emphatic')
            p In addition to hyperlinks, another tool you can use to connect to a webpage, file, email address, or slide is called an action button. Action buttons are built-in button shapes you can add to a presentation and set to link to another slide, play a sound, or perform some other action. When someone clicks or moves over the button, the selected action will occur. Action buttons can do many of the same things as hyperlinks. Their easy-to-understand style makes them especially useful for self-running presentations at booths and kiosks.
            p You can insert action buttons on one slide at a time, or you can insert an action button that will show up on every slide. The second option can be useful if you want every slide to link back to a specific slide, like the title page or table of contents.
