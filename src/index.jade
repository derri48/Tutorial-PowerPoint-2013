        h1 Working with your Microsoft Account and OneDrive.
		p.
		Many of the new features in Office 2013 are geared towards saving and sharing files online. To use these features, you'll need to get a free Microsoft account (previously called a Windows Live ID) if you don't already have one. You can then log in to your Microsoft account to access your OneDrive which is an online storage space for your documents and other files.

		OneDrive was previously called SkyDrive. There's nothing fundamentally different about the way OneDrive works—it's just a new name for an existing service. Over the next few months, you may still see SkyDrive in some Microsoft products.
